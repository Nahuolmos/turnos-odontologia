# Skill Registry

**Delegator use only.** Any agent that launches sub-agents reads this registry to resolve compact rules, then injects them directly into sub-agent prompts. Sub-agents do NOT read this registry or individual SKILL.md files.

Project: turnos-odontologia (SaaS odontologia: FastAPI + PostgreSQL/Redis + React/Vite). Stack pin: Backend Python/FastAPI/JWT/SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL/Redis/Docker-Compose, Frontend React/TypeScript/Vite, mobile-first, 1 clinica en v1.

## Compact Rules

Pre-digested rules per skill. Delegators copy matching blocks into sub-agent prompts as `## Project Standards (auto-resolved)`.

### vercel-react-best-practices
- Eliminate waterfalls: parallelize independent ops with Promise.all, defer await into branches, check cheap sync conditions before awaiting
- Stream with Suspense boundaries; start promises early, await late in API routes
- Import directly (no barrel files); next/dynamic for heavy components; load analytics/logging after hydration; preload on hover/focus
- Server: React.cache() per-request dedup, LRU cross-request, hoist static I/O to module level, minimize RSC→client serialization, never module-level mutable request state
- Re-renders: derive state during render (not effects), primitive effect deps, functional setState, startTransition/useDeferredValue for non-urgent work, never define components inside components
- Full rule detail lives in per-rule files (`rules/<rule>.md`); compiled guide in skill AGENTS.md

### frontend-design
- Ground every design in the brief's subject (odontologia: clinica/paciente/recepcion) — never generic SaaS-card kit, cream+terracotta default, or acid-on-black default
- One display family max + one body family, clearly distinct; line length <80 chars; no single-accent-word headlines, no ALL-CAPS labels, no meta "A · B · C" strings
- Structural devices (borders, numbering 01/02/03, eyebrows, dividers) only when they encode real info — numbers only for true sequences
- One orchestrated motion moment max; motion answers user action (open/expand/confirm), never scattered fade-slide entrances
- Two-pass process: compact token plan (4-6 hex palette, type roles, layout+ASCII wireframe, principles) → uniqueness review vs brief → build; spend boldness in one element
- Copy: user vocabulary (not system terms), active-voice CTAs naming the exact outcome, errors explain fix without apologizing, sentence case

### supabase-postgres-best-practices
- Load BEFORE any Postgres change — even one column or one query; read the specific `references/<rule>.md` file for the applicable rule
- Query: missing/partial indexes first suspect for slow queries; prove with EXPLAIN before/after
- Connections: pool everything (PgBouncer/Supabase pooler); never per-request connections; watch for exhaustion under worker+API concurrency
- Security: RLS on every tenant table (clinic_id), test policies with wrong-tenant reads; least-privilege roles for API/worker/migrations
- Schema: right-sized types, CHECKs for invariants, gist EXCLUDE for no-overlap (turnos por sillon/odontologo), FK indexes on hot join paths
- Concurrency: short transactions, advisory locks or SKIP LOCKED for job claims (scheduler T-24h, expiracion pendiente_sena 30min), never long-held locks in request path

### test-driven-development
- IRON LAW: no production code without a failing test first; code written before the test gets deleted, not adapted
- RED must fail for the right reason (feature missing, not typo/error); GREEN is minimal code only — no extra features, no drive-by refactors
- Verify both transitions by running tests (RED fail → GREEN pass); refactor only on green, keep suite green
- Full project suite (`pytest`, not just your file) must pass before done; any red test — even uncaused — is named in the report
- Tests assert real behavior with real code (mocks only if unavoidable); one behavior per test, name describes behavior
- Bug fix = failing reproduction test first; hard-to-test = simplify design (DI, smaller surface), never skip

### auth-implementation-patterns
- Separate AuthN (who) from AuthZ (what); enforce RBAC server-side on every endpoint — never client-side checks only
- Passwords: bcrypt/argon2 only, strong policy, secure expiring reset tokens; never plaintext
- JWT: short-lived access (15-30 min), rotated refresh in httpOnly+secure+sameSite cookies; never JWT in localStorage (XSS)
- Claims must include sub/clinic_id/rol/jti; validate all three per request (tenant isolation = clinic_id match)
- Rate-limit auth endpoints (login 5/60s per IP+email via Redis); log login attempts/failed auth; rotate secrets regularly
- OAuth2/OIDC for social/SSO — delegate, don't reimplement; CSRF protection for session-based flows; MFA where possible

### python-fastapi-development
- Stack: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async), Pydantic v2, Alembic, pytest; config via Pydantic settings, 12 env vars, never hardcode
- Structure: modular domain/infra/api; routers split public/internal/webhooks; response_model on every endpoint; request validation via Pydantic schemas
- DB: session per request with proper close/rollback; migrations via Alembic only; test DB isolated with fixtures
- Auth: JWT strategy + hashing + middleware per auth-implementation-patterns; pick one strategy per service
- Errors: custom exceptions + handlers with consistent error envelope; request logging; no stack traces to clients
- Quality gates: pytest >80% coverage, mypy clean, ruff/black clean, OpenAPI docs complete, Dockerfile+compose for api/postgres/redis/worker
